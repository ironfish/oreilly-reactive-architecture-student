# Exercise 16 > Use Router

In this exercise, we will introduce parallelism through the use of routers.

- Get rid of the bottleneck by using a router for the `Barista`.
- Use an externally configured `round-robin` pool router.
- Run the `run` command to boot the `CoffeeHouseApp` with different router configuration options; watch the throughput.
- Use the `run` command to boot the `CoffeeHouseApp` and verify everything works as expected.
- Use the `test` command to verify the solution works as expected.
- Use the `next` command to move to the next exercise.
